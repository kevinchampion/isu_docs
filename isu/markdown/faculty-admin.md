## Updating Faculty Departments

There are three faculty taxonomies that affect faculty/staff profiles.

A link to each taxonomy can be found by navigating to [http://cms.indstate.edu/admin/structure/taxonomy](http://cms.indstate.edu/admin/structure/taxonomy)

![Faculty Taxonomies](../assets/images/TaxonomyVocabList.png "Faculty Taxonomies")

Below are descriptions of each taxonomy and their intended purpose:

* **Faculty Department - Banner**
	* Notice the word **Banner** in the taxonomy name. This is because these terms are the departments that come directly from **Banner**.
	* Terms in this taxonomy are automatically created during the faculty/staff import. This is the term that is associated with each faculty/staff profile. It is hidden from view and cannot be updated because this information comes directly from the Banner import file.
	* Inside this taxonomy are two additional fields which define a relationship to the taxonomies **Faculty Department** and **Parent Organization**.
* **Faculty Department**
	* This is the **English** version of the **Banner** department. On the **Faculty Department - Banner** term, you can select the **Faculty Department** that the Banner department should relate to.
	* This is the department that is displayed on Faculty/Staff profiles.
	* This is a parent term of the **Faculty Department - Banner** which allows multiple Banner departments to share the same parent department. An example of this would be the **Networks Financial Institute**. It is a single department, but there are multiple Banner departments that make up this department. For example, NETWORKS, Networks-Research and Networks-Student Scholarships make up this department.
* **Parent Organization**
	* This is the **Parent Organization** of the **Faculty Department - Banner** department. On the **Faculty Department - Banner** term, you can select the **Parent Organization** that the Banner department should relate to.
	* This is also a parent term of the **Faculty Department - Banner** which serves to group Banner departments into colleges/organizations. This relationship was created to allow external sites, such as college sites, to query faculty/staff based on their college.

## Updating your Profile Image

If you have an adequate role, you can use an alternate image for your Faculty/Staff profile.

On the [Update Faculty Profile](http://cms.indstate.edu/admin/faculty-edit) page, scroll down below the normal Banner Image and you should have an option to add or update the **Override Banner Image** field.

## Banner Import File

The Banner Import file holds data that will import nightly and create/update faculty/staff profiles. It is important that the website knows the name of this file so that imports will not be interrupted.

If the name of the file has changed, you will need to update it in the **Faculty Settings** which can be found by nagivating to the [Faculty Settings Page](http://cms.indstate.edu/admin/config/people/isu_faculty)

<h2 id="updating-faculty-departments">Updating Faculty Departments</h2>
<p>There are three faculty taxonomies that affect faculty/staff profile departments.</p>
<p>A link to each taxonomy can be found by navigating to <a href="http://cms.indstate.edu/admin/structure/taxonomy">http://cms.indstate.edu/admin/structure/taxonomy</a></p>
<p><img alt="Faculty Taxonomies" src="../assets/images/TaxonomyVocabList.png" title="Faculty Taxonomies" /></p>
<p>Below are descriptions of each taxonomy and their intended purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faculty Department - Banner</strong><ul>
<li>Notice the word <strong>Banner</strong> in the taxonomy name. This is because these terms are the departments that come directly from <strong>Banner</strong>.</li>
<li>Terms in this taxonomy are automatically created during the faculty/staff import. This is the term that is associated with each faculty/staff profile. It is hidden from view and cannot be updated because this information comes directly from the Banner import file.</li>
<li>Inside this taxonomy are two additional fields which define a relationship to the taxonomies <strong>Faculty Department</strong> and <strong>Parent Organization</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Faculty Department</strong><ul>
<li>This is the <strong>English</strong> version of the <strong>Banner</strong> department. On the <strong>Faculty Department - Banner</strong> term, you can select the <strong>Faculty Department</strong> that the Banner department should relate to.</li>
<li>This is the department that is displayed on Faculty/Staff profiles.</li>
<li>This is a parent term of the <strong>Faculty Department - Banner</strong> which allows multiple Banner departments to share the same parent department. An example of this would be the <strong>Networks Financial Institute</strong>. It is a single department, but there are multiple Banner departments that make up this department. For example, NETWORKS, Networks-Research and Networks-Student Scholarships make up this department.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Parent Organization</strong><ul>
<li>This is the <strong>Parent Organization</strong> of the <strong>Faculty Department - Banner</strong> department. On the <strong>Faculty Department - Banner</strong> term, you can select the <strong>Parent Organization</strong> that the Banner department should relate to.</li>
<li>This is also a parent term of the <strong>Faculty Department - Banner</strong> which serves to group Banner departments into colleges/organizations. This relationship was created to allow external sites, such as college sites, to query faculty/staff based on their college.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="faculty-profile-taxonomy">Faculty Profile Taxonomy</h3>
<p>In addition to the faculty department and parent organization taxonomies, there are two taxonomy vocabularies that are included in a faculty profile:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expertise<ul>
<li><a href="http://cms.indstate.edu/admin/structure/taxonomy/expertise">http://cms.indstate.edu/admin/structure/taxonomy/expertise</a>  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Research Interests<ul>
<li><a href="http://cms.indstate.edu/admin/structure/taxonomy/research_interests">http://cms.indstate.edu/admin/structure/taxonomy/research_interests</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can add/update terms by navigating to links above. Faculty/staff members can then select which <strong>Expertise</strong> and <strong>Research Interests</strong> apply to their profile.</p>

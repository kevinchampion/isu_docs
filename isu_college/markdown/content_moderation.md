## What's moderation?

Content moderation is the ability to setup and maintain an editing workflow for content that's created for the site. The purpose is to have a defined set of steps that content should go through before it is eventually published to the site. This helps with managing control over the content that's published to the site by maintaining a structure and set of logic over who can publish content and how it can be published.

It can help to ensure that more than one person reviews content for things like typos, style guide, and content strategy to help produce higher quality content. It can help to enforce a set of standards around how content gets published to the site. It can help to enforce an approval process for content publishing. And it can help to manage the editing and moderation process to facilitate improving and keeping track of content in progress.

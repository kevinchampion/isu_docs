## What are inner pages?

Inner pages are a **content type** similar to a page, but are considered child pages and therefore inherit properties of the content you are creating an inner page of.

For example, if you were to create an **inner page** for a Department, the **inner page** would inherit the top banner and Department Menu of that Department. Before creating an Inner Page, make sure you have already created the parent Page, Department, Center, or Program that the Inner Page will be a child of.

## Creating inner pages

### 1. Open the 'Create inner page' form
In the Administration Menu, navigate to:

	My Workbench > Create content > Inner page

![Add a inner page](../assets/images/InnerPageAdd.png "Add a inner page")

### 2. Select a banner
A banner can be inherited since this will be an Inner Page, so you can choose to inherit the banner or add a new or existing [Banner Slide](banner_slides.md)

For a more detailed tutorial on banners, see the [Banner Slide](banner_slides.md) tutorial.

By default the banner is inherited. Should you not want to inherit the [Banner](banner_slides.md), you may add a new or existing banner. First, click on the **Inherit Banner** section and uncheck the **Inherit Banner** checkbox.

![Banner Add](../assets/images/BannerInherit.png "Banner Add")

Click on the **Banner** section and proceed to add a new or existing banner.

![Banner Add](../assets/images/InnerPageBannerAdd.png "Banner Add")

### 3. Choose a title
Enter the **Title** for this inner page.

![inner page Title](../assets/images/PageTitle.png "inner page Title")

### 4. Add copy
Enter the **Body** of this department. This is the main copy of your inner page.

![inner page Body](../assets/images/PageBody.png "inner page Body")

Using the editor toolbar, you can add images or format your copy.

![Inner page Body Toolbar](../assets/images/PageBodyToolbar.png "inner page Body Toolbar")

### 5. Add an image

Select an **Image** for this inner page.

![inner page Image](../assets/images/PageImage.png "inner page Image")

### 6. Menu settings

Choose a **Menu link title** which will be the name of the menu item displayed.

![Menu Link Title](../assets/images/MenuLinkTitle.png "Menu Link Title")

The **Parent item** is the location where this inner page will be found in the menu. The **Parent item** must be content such as a Department, Page, Program or Center.

![Menu Parent](../assets/images/MenuParent.png "Menu Parent")

More detail on the remaining items in this section can be found in the [Menu settings]() documentation.

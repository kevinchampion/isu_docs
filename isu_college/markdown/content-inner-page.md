## What are inner pages?

Inner pages are a **content type** similar to a page, but are considered child pages and therefore inherit properties of the content you are creating an inner page of.

For example, if you were to create an **inner page** for a Department, the **inner page** would inherit the top banner and Department Menu of that Department. 

## Creating inner pages

### 1. Open the 'Create inner page' form
In the Administration Menu, navigate to:
	
	My Workbench > Create content > Inner page
		
![Add a inner page](../assets/images/InnerPageAdd.png "Add a inner page")

### 2. Select a banner
A banner can be inherited since this will be an Inner Page, so you can choose to inherit the banner or add a new or existing [Banner Slide](banner_slides.md)

For a more detailed tutorial on banners, see the [Banner Slide](banner_slides.md) tutorial.

By default the banner is inherited. Should you not want to inherit the [Banner](banner_slides.md), you may add a new or existing banner. First, click on the **Inherit Banner** section and uncheck the **Inherit Banner** checkbox.

![Banner Add](../assets/images/BannerInherit.png "Banner Add")

Click on the **Banner** section and proceed to add a new or existing banner.

### 3. Choose a title
Enter the **Title** for this inner page.

### 4. Add copy
Enter the **Body** of this department. This is the main copy of your inner page. 

![inner page Body](../assets/images/inner pageBody.png "inner page Body")

Using the editor toolbar, you can add images or format your copy.

![inner page Body Toolbar](../assets/images/inner pageBodyToolbar.png "inner page Body Toolbar")

### 5. Add an image

Select an **Image** for this inner page.

### 6. Menu settings

Choose a **Menu link title** which will be the name of the menu item displayed.

![Menu Link Title](../assets/images/MenuLinkTitle.png "Menu Link Title")

The **Parent item** is the location where this inner page will be found in the menu. The **Parent item** must be content such as a Department, Page, Program or Center.

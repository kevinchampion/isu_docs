## What are blocks?

Blocks are the boxes of content (such as "User Login" or "Search form") that can be displayed in sections (such as header or footer) on your page.

## Administering blocks

### Navigate to the block administration page

	Structure > Blocks

![Blocks](../assets/images/AdminMenuBlocks.png "Blocks")

The block administration page also lets you specify the vertical sort-order of the blocks.

Configuring blocks allows you customize it's visibility and location (region) it is in.

### Visiblity Settings

#### Pages

Individual blocks can be configured to only show/hide on certain pages. This can be a path like "about" for the about page, "about/*" where the asterisk is any path that starts with "about". An important exception is the frontpage: "<front>".

## Adding a block

### Navigate to the add block page

	Structure > Blocks > Add block

### Configure your new block

The only required fields of this new block is the **Block description** and **Block body**.

The **Block description** is only used to help identify the block from the block administration page.

the **Block body** uses a formatting toolbar similar to other textareas you will find in other forms on the site. 

Finally, configure the [visibility settings](#visibility-settings) of the new block.

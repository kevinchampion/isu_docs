## Intro

Banners are called "Media Assets" and can be created while you are updating or creating a page. Banners are re-usable which means you can use the same banner on multiple pages without having to re-create the banner. When you add more than one banner to a page, it creates a slide-show display.

## Creating

![Content type](../assets/images/_kbz.png "Banner slide content type")

![Banner slide nodequeue](../assets/images/dk4p.png "Banner slide nodequeue")

![Banner slider view](../assets/images/j6x8.png "Banner slider view")


### Title

The title field of the node is for internal administrative use only.

### Image

The image field is for uploading the actual banner image.

![Banner image field](../assets/images/qztv.png "Banner image field")

### Link

The link field is for applying a link to the entire banner overlay area. If a link is not present, the overlay will not link anywhere. This is different than the previous caption technique which only linked content within the separate caption field.

### Overlay title

The banner overlay content comes from the "Overlay title" field. This field has a number of token replacements for building the textual overlay content. In essence, these tokens are replaced by html elements with classes that allow for targeting the elements using css selectors in order to style them. The description of the field describes the token options and gives examples of how to use them.

With the new changes, the caption field content should be placed inside the [caption] token wrapper. For the "page" style overlay, the [last] token wrapper should be placed around the last word in the overlay title in order to change the text color of the last work to match the design specification.

### Overlay position

The overlay position field determines whether the overlay will be aligned on the left or right side of the banner image.

### Overlay vertical align

The overlay vertical align field determines the vertical placement of the overlay within the banner image area. This uses the "vertical-align" css property and the value of this field should be a percentage.

### Overlay style

The overlay style determines which style overlay will be used. The "home" style features the Arvo font and has all white text and lines with a tight padding and margin. The "page" style features the Helvetica font and has light blue features and a salmon colored title text color with wider padding and margins.

The original site launch contained only one banner slider style and contained a separate caption field for writing the textual caption beneath the main text overlay section.

## Styles

## Updating

## How it works

The slide nodes require an image and a textual message for the banner overlay.



## Add a new banner slider

The process of adding a new banner slider, that is an entirely new slideshow for placement in a new section of the site, requires three steps.

1. A new nodequeue must be created
2. A new view display must be created
3. The new block must be placed with appropriate visibility settings

### Nodequeue

In order to control which slides will be used and what order they'll display in, a new nodequeue must be created. From /admin/structure/nodequeue select "Add simple queue":

![Add queue](../assets/images/-evf.png "Add queue")

Fill out the configuration form for creating the new queue and make sure to restrict the content type to only allow "Slide" nodes to be added to the queue.

### View display

In order to render the slides in the nodequeue as a slideshow, a views block display is used. From /admin/structure/views/view/homepage_slider/edit review the view that renders the slideshows. Clone the homepage slider display and then modify the titles and options of the new display to match the subject of your new slider.

![Clone display](../assets/images/gk83.png "Clone display")

After cloning the display, the most important detail that must be changed is configuring the relationship to use the new nodequeue. In the "advanced" column under the "Relationship" heading, select the "Nodequeue: Queue" item.

![Nodequeue relationship](../assets/images/2x65.png "Nodequeue relationship")

Within the configuration settings window, change the setting to limit the results to the new Nodequeue that you created in the step above. If this isn't changed, the new views display will render the items from a different Nodequeue.

![Choose correct queue](../assets/images/y-i7.png "Choose correct queue")

Save the configuration and the view.

### Block placement

When you saved the new view display, it automatically generated a new block on the block placement configuration page located at /admin/structure/blocks. Find the newly created block, configure its visibility settings to restrict it to only display when and where you need it to, and place it in the "Banner" region.

## What is a widget?

A widget is a block of content that can be placed on any page on the site.

There are different types of widgets:

* **Basic block**: Static content which can include copy, links, or media embeds.
* **Image block**: A single image. Used with mini panels.
* **Code block**: Expert use only! Add javascript or php to pages.
* **Link block**: A single link to an external or internal page.
* **RSS Feed Widget**: Shows results from RSS feeds. Used to display News and Events from the main ISU site.

## Basic Blocks
**Basic Blocks** allow content authors to create simple text and HTML markup to be placed within and rendered using a formatting toolbar.

## Image Blocks

**Image Blocks** allow content authors to create a block which consists of a single image. 

## Code Blocks

**Code Blocks** allow content authors to insert javascript or php into the page. This action should only be completed by advanced users.

## Link Blocks

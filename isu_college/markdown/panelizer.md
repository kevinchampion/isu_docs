## How to add or remove content on (customize) a page 
Most pages that you find on the site can be customized. Reusable content can be added, removed, or assigned to different regions of a page.

In order to determine if a page can be customized, look for the buttons **Customize this page** and **Change this layout** located on the bottom of the page.

### Page sections

Depending on a page's layout, there could be many sections of a page: Top, bottom, left, right and middle. It's not uncommon to see a left below or right below section as well.

Located at the top right of each section are two buttons with two specific purposes:

* The **paint brush** controls the **style** of the section.

* The **add/plus sign** lets you **add content** to the section.

### Reusable content types

Only certain content can be added to sections of a page. Reusable content such as blocks, widgets, images, etc are examples of reusable content. If you created a piece of content on the site, chances are you can add it to a section in a page.

Clicking the **add/plus sign** allows you to add content to a section. Content is categorized based on type. In most cases, Blocks and Miscellaneous type content will be the main categories you will be searching for content.

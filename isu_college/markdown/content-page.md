## What are pages?

Pages are a **content type** that can be used to create a page on your site which contains copy and/or widgets. A Page defines a section of the site that can be considered a "sub-site" homepage within that section. Subsequent child pages of that section should be built out using the [Inner Page](../content-inner-page.html) content type. Typically, Pages will be top-level menu items, but from time-to-time it will be appropriate for them to fit farther down in the menu hierarchy. The key with Pages is to use them judiciously when you're attempting to define a section homepage or a single one-off page that doesn't have any children.

## Creating pages

### 1. Open the 'Create Page' form
In the Administration Menu, navigate to:

	My Workbench > Create content > Page

![Add a page](../assets/images/PageAdd.png "Add a page")

### 2. Add a banner
Add a new or existing [Banner Slide](banner_slides.md).

![Banner Add](../assets/images/BannerAdd.png "Banner Add")

### 3. Choose a title
Enter the **Title** for this page.

![Page Title](../assets/images/PageTitle.png "Page Title")

### 4. Add copy
Enter the **Body** of this department. This is the main copy of your page.

![Page Body](../assets/images/PageBody.png "Page Body")

Using the editor toolbar, you can add images or format your copy.

![Page Body Toolbar](../assets/images/PageBodyToolbar.png "Page Body Toolbar")

### 5. Add an image

Select an **Image** for this page.

![Page Image](../assets/images/PageImage.png "Page Image")

### 6. Menu settings

Choose a **Menu link title** which will be the name of the menu item displayed.


![Menu Link Title](../assets/images/MenuLinkTitle.png "Menu Link Title")

The **Parent item** is the location where this page will be found in the menu.

![Menu Parent](../assets/images/MenuParent.png "Menu Parent")

More detail on the remaining items in this section can be found in the [Menu settings]() documentation.

### 7. URL path settings

By default, the url of this page will be generated automatically. If you would like to customize the url of this page, you can uncheck **Generate automatic URL alias**.

![Path Checkbox](../assets/images/PathCheckbox.png "Path Checkbox")

Then you may enter a custom **URL alias**
